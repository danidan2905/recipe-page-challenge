## My process

### Built with

The challenge was developed using HTML and CSS (flexbox) and... nothing else!

### What I learned

The CSS styles and HTML tags used weren't new for me, but I learned to color HTML elements using HSL like this:

```css
.the-most-basic-HTML-element{
    color: hsl(14, 45%, 77%);
}
```
